"""preprocessor.py
Annotation Preprocessing Utility.

This module provides a utility class for preprocessing image annotations from
various formats. It allows for loading annotations, splitting datasets based on
provided criteria, and combining annotations from different datasets into a
unified format.

Returns:
    DataFrame: A Pandas DataFrame containing the preprocessed annotations.

prep2.py
This module provides a DatasetPreprocessor class to preprocess various datasets
for object detection tasks. The class includes methods to handle different
formats of datasets and convert them into a standardized format suitable for
object detection models. The standardized format includes center coordinates,
width-height format for bounding boxes, normalized coordinates, and mapped
class labels to class IDs.
